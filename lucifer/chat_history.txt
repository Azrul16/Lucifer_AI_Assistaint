You: what is python

Lucifer: Python is a high-level interpreted programming language that allows you to write and execute code at runtime.

What does this mean

This means Python can run without being installed on your computer first. You just need to have it in the same directory as where you want your program to be executed (usually called "bin" or "/usr/bin"). Once a script is saved when an interpreter like IDLE PyCharm etc. runs it - then all of that code gets run by Python.

In short: You can write and execute scripts without having the full installed version. Just save your files in one place (like "bin") to get started!
